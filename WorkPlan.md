Start by looking through the WHOLE Instruction list, and see what needs to be accomplished.  

Determine what elements are required for the weekend project. 

Set up the form to take information. Make the submit button a button.  

set up a dummy info for the table to make sure that the table has the correct rows and attributes. What variables will we need to store?

how many functions are we going to need?
Submit data function
when data is submitted, clear the form inputs. 
if data is not entered, don't accept teh submit. 

calculate monthly cost function based on the input salary
calculate the total montly cost for all employees on the list
Delete function (which initially does't ahve to remove the montly cost associated, but eventually should)
If monthly cost is over 20k, apply a new class tag to implement an OVER-BUDGET indication

stretch. when removing an employee, need to identify which employee was removed in order to correctly adjust the monthly cost number. 


play with CSS to style it nicely. use the tools that we have found in the assignments and the in class projects to make it easy.

look into the data-testid identifier to better understand its uses and why we are using here. 


Further adjustments:
not allowing submit without all form inputs filled. 
nested functions?
generating the table contents with loops rather than hard coding into the submit.
